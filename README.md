# Enuxion (ENU) Core 👁

Enuxion is a decentralized infrastructure layer built on the Solana network. Managed by **Enuxion Lab**, this project focuses on creating terminal-based utility tools and lightweight L2 solutions.

## 🛠 Vision
Our goal is to transition from speculative assets to utility-driven ecosystems. Enuxion provides a suite of tools for network monitoring, data encryption, and automated node validation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/core`: Main protocol logic and consensus scripts.
- `/tools`: Utility scripts for Solana network interaction.
- `/docs`: Technical documentation and whitepaper drafts.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Token Launch & Community formation.
- **Phase 2**: Terminal OS (Alpha) - WebGL interface for node management.
- **Phase 3**: Integration with decentralized compute providers.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Rust / Go / TypeScript
- **Network**: Solana
- **Engine**: Enuxion Proprietary Logic
